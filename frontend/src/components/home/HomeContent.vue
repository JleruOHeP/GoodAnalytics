            Business analysis from the mathematical point of view always fascinated me. I like to think that a properly defined model is needed for any business. And if you can throw statistical data into this model - it will do wonders!
          </p>

          <p>
            You are a small business owner and you have a model in mind. But there is a number of variables that can affect the performance of the business. It is really hard to hold everything in your head. I want to help you to run simulations over various input parameters to find the optimal setup for your business. Combine internal properties of processes so the profit is maximized.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can save the historical performance of the business and compare the current state with the desired optimal one. And find the best way to correct the actual model towards this optimized model!

            I offer consultancy services with a strong technical background. For simplicity, lets split my approach into 3 stages:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h5>Explore</h5>
              <p>Interview with the business owner - to get some initial data. It is not necessarily the best data, but we can use it as a starting point.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Analyse</h5>
              <p>Then I will build a business model and run the simulation to get the answer based on initial data</p>
              <p>Business owners will get access to a custom website where they will be able to capture additional statistical data about their business performance and see the model working.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Implement</h5>
              <p>Finally, based on the model outputs business owners might try to optimize their business. Or gather extra data to have a better solution. Or even rethink the initial question! I can help with business audits and provide some extra suggestions in regards business processes.</p>
              <p>And if needed - we can repeat from the begining to make business even better!</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

            <h4>So, what kind of business can benefit from our services?</h4>
            <p>
              Short answer - any! A couple of examples:

              You have an efficient IT consultancy company. Will you hire a new salesperson or a new developer? It is a question of a fine balance between available work and potential output.
            </p>

            <p>
              As long as the marginal benefit of adding another salesperson exceeds the cost, you should expect the company to keep adding salespeople, which can often result in a sales force that's larger than the engineering team. But when to stop?
            </p>

            <p>
              It will be much better to be able to precisely predict contract growth based on the size of the sales team and compare it to what you can cover with your engineering department.

            You have a nice and cozy fish and chips shop and feel that it is time to grow. Will you run an advertisement campaign or not? What is the expected outcome, price, timeframes of this campaign?
          </p>

          <p>
            Maybe it is better to update your storefront with a zomato reference? Will it help to drive more customers?
          </p>

          <p>
            When you have enough data available there is a very high chance that statistical modeling will give you exact answers to all of those questions. It is much easier to compare apples to apples rather than trying to estimate the outcome using only emotions.
